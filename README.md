The weather app allows a userr to search for a cities weather and displays it along with a five day forecast. The app also displays, the UV index, humidity, wind and a picture representing the current weather. 

After a city is found it is added to the search history and saved to local storage. If a user clicks on a prior search, the prior cities weather is displayed. A clear search history button has also been added. 

#Challenges

The use of the javascropt Date object was challenging. Getting the UV index to work from the longitude and latitude was also another challenge.  I had help from a few classmates and a good friend that is a fullstack web dev.
